## Studyng the basics and comparing the differences between Lombok and Records in Java
### Lombok
- Lombok is a library that helps to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.
- It provides annotations to generate getters, setters, constructors, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.
- Lombok is a compile-time only dependency and it does not add any runtime dependencies.
- Lombok is not a part of the Java language, it is a library that can be added to the project.

### Records
- Records are a new feature in Java 14 that provides a compact syntax for declaring classes that are simple data carriers.
- Records are immutable by default and they provide a concise way to create classes that are used to store data.
- Records are a part of the Java language and they are a language feature.
- Records are a preview feature in Java 14 and they are expected to be finalized in Java 16.
- Records are similar to Lombok in that they help to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.
- Records are more powerful than Lombok because they are a language feature and they are supported by the Java compiler.
- Records are a better choice for new projects because they are a part of the Java language and they are expected to be finalized in the future.

### Comparing Lombok and Records
- Lombok is a good choice for existing projects that are using Lombok and want to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.
- Records are a better choice for new projects that want to use a language feature to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.
- Records are more powerful than Lombok because they are a language feature and they are supported by the Java compiler.
